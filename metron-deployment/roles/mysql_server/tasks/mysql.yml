# mysql must be running for the 'mysql_client' role to function properly.  that
# role grants access to mysql clients connecting from external hosts (think
# storm topologies doing geoip enrichment).
#
# ideally the logic in 'mysql_client' would be moved to 'mysql_server' so that
# mysql could be started, access granted, and then shutdown after this is
# complete.
